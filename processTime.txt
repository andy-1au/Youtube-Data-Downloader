NOTE: ffmpeg -codecs outputs a list of codecs 

NOTE: for multi-threading, I added my own threads (not sure if I will still use the thread parameter in output(), will be testing that)

NOTE: 3 threads seems to be working for GPU memory allocation and not skipping videos

UPDATE: specifying threads in output function doesn't matter, ffmpeg defaults to the most optimal 

UPDATE: h264_nvenc is slower by about 25%, but windows can play without extra applications

UPDATE: Multi-thread works sometimes for some videos depending on max number of threads
